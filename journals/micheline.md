Peer coded with Karis as I am having has to be a docker issue where the code is not being shown in react.  What I noticed is that I made basically did all the work in the Content Card and was inherting it into the Explore whereas the Content Card should have just been that and Explore should have tied it all together.  It made sense to actually have what made up the explore as different component so we seperated what I had and finished building it out

I realized that I do not need all the components that I had for the Explore Page.  I was importing 3 (Header, card, button) which was not efficient and combined them all into one component which makes a lot of sense.

Spent some time cleaning up the code but majority of the time trying to call the API for stocks and new items

Docker broke again so I am have to rebuild my containers every time.  Finally have implemented the buttons to work with the swipe function.

Now need to figure out how to add the apis

November 28
Fixed Docker so now things should be rocking and rolling going forward.  Figured out useCallback method in react that I am going to implement to the explore page.  Also to make this simpler we are certainly going to have to use the buttons vs the swipe feature

November 26

Since I working on the interface of the Explore page I am also doing the Content card because the two go hand in hand

November 22

Docker blew up so I did nothing but it was interesting to see.  I was maybe 25% there on figuring out fixing the issue

November 21
Today was a good day.  Karis came up with the idea that we should implement an add and update feature in one to certain aspects of the app.  After she demoed it, we all decided that we should add it to the saved news items and stocks and that is what we did.  Good move with the team.  We got started on the React, we have run into one issue but it seems very easy to fix so that is what I am working on for the evening and reading about Redux

I broke Docker again.  My container for real

We decided to cut and consolidate.  We are no longer going to have an explore / save table.  We are going to call them directly from the api so we do not need to the table to store them.  We as a team made small changes to the code and we put them in saved queries and routers because there is an overlap.

I can’t get my API docker container to run. Keeps failing saying there is no migration modue, but there is. But I think I know what the issue is .. but I’m going to bed its 130 lol

I spent most of the day trying to practice FAST APIs with the walkthrough videos as I was doing it with Curtis.  After finally getting over the cursor error I broke Docker.

Ask about this:  My docker containers were up and running and doing the appropriate request BUT I had to kill the containers then rebuild them every single time I wanted to see the change on the webpage.  Do not ask me how I did this but it was the most annoyingest thing ever

BUT I now got through all the videos and under FAST Apis and how to code it
